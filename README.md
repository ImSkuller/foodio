# foodio
This was created for my html project. So this is not a fully functional model, This is just a front-end project and you are free to use this template for your personal projects or anything.

# File Structure
I tried to keep the file structure as simple as possible, Making different folders for the different sections and its own indivijual html css files so you can edit each section without facing any issues.

## Home
The `Home` folder contains the main html css files for the homepage.

## Section
The `Section` folder contains the html and css files for the different menu secions.
The `Section` folder also contains the final `Order Placed` Page.

##  Assets
The `Assets` folder contains the faviocn, logo and all the other images for the website. This includes the main menu images and the sub menu images.

# Info
I added comments in the code to make it easier to edit and read.
